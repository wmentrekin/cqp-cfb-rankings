\section*{College Football Ranking System Using Quadratic Programming



This project is a custom-built college football ranking system using convex optimization, specifically a quadratic program (QP). It is designed to generate weekly rankings for FBS teams during the college football season and produce preseason prior ratings based on the full previous season.



#\section*{Overview



The model:

- Assigns a rating to each FBS team

- Penalizes teams ranked below teams they lost to

- Uses a dummy variable to handle losses to FCS opponents

- Incorporates home/away/neutral site effects through an "alpha" weight

- Supports soft-margin loss modeling using a convex slack system

- Optionally uses prior season ratings that decay over time via a connectivity-based lambda



The program fetches data via the [CollegeFootballData API](https://collegefootballdata.com), processes the games, and formulates a QP using `cvxpy`.

#\section*{Full Model (In-Season with Priors)



##\section*{Decision Variables

- \( r_i \): rating of team \( i \)

- \( z_{ij}^{(k)} \ge 0 \): slack variable for the \( k \)th game between team \( i \) and team \( j \)

- \( r_{\text{FCS}} \): dummy rating for FCS opponents

- \( z_{i, \text{FCS}} \ge 0 \): slack for FBS team \( i \) losing to an FCS opponent



##\section*{Parameters

- \( s_{ij}^{(k)} \): score margin for game \( k \) between \( i \) and \( j \)

- \( \alpha_{ij}^{(k)} \): location weight (home/away/neutral)

- \( r_i^{(0)} \): prior rating for team \( i \)

- \( \lambda \): weight on prior deviation, decays as season progresses

- \( \beta \): penalty multiplier for FCS loss slack

- \( \mu \): penalty multiplier for deviation from FCS minimum rating

- \( M \): large constant (\( M = 200 \))



##\section*{Objective Function

Minimize:

\[

\sum_{(i,j,k): i \text{ lost to } j} \alpha_{ij}^{(k)} s_{ij}^{(k)} z_{ij}^{(k)}

+ \gamma \sum_{(i,j,k): i \text{ beat } j} \left( \max(0, r_j + s_{ij}^{(k)} - r_i) \right)^2

+ \lambda \sum_i (r_i - r_i^{(0)})^2

+ \beta \sum_i z_{i,\text{FCS}}

+ \mu (r_{\text{FCS}} - R_{\min})^2

\]



##\section*{Constraints

- \( r_i + z_{ij}^{(k)} \le r_j + M \) for each loss by \( i \) to \( j \)

- \( r_i + z_{i,\text{FCS}} \le r_{\text{FCS}} + M \) for each FCS loss

- \( R_{\min} \le r_{\text{FCS}} \le R_{\max} \)

- \( r_i \ge 0 \) for all FBS teams

#\section*{Prior Model (Preseason using last season's results)



This is a special case of the full model:

- \( \lambda = 0 \) since no prior exists

- Same structure, minus the prior term

- Still includes the soft-margin penalty to spread ratings

- Still handles FCS losses and dummy FCS team rating



---



#\section*{Usage



To run the model:

1. Make sure your `.env` file contains a valid `API_KEY` from [collegefootballdata.com](https://collegefootballdata.com/key).

2. Run `model.py` to:

   - Get prior ratings from the previous season (`get_prior_ratings(year)`)

   - Run the full QP for a specific week (`get_ratings(year, week)`)



---



#\section*{Dependencies

- `cvxpy`

- `networkx`

- `pandas`

- `requests`

- `python-dotenv`



---



#\section*{Future Plans

- Automate weekly updates using cloud scheduler + backend storage

- Build and host a frontend for sharing rankings

- Expand to other sports (e.g., NBA) with repeated matchups

- Incorporate player-level data, roster changes, or betting spreads as soft signal
